## üåü Project Overview

This repository showcases a comprehensive **3-in-1 Power BI project** analyzing a loan default dataset of approximately **260,000 applicants**. The project demonstrates end-to-end Business Intelligence capabilities, from **data sourcing and transformation** to **advanced DAX calculations** and **insightful visualizations**, all geared toward providing actionable insights for financial risk assessment and decision-making.

The core of this project lies in its ability to dissect complex loan data, identify patterns in defaults, understand applicant demographics, and calculate key financial risk metrics. It leverages **Power BI Dataflows** for efficient data management, connecting directly to a **Microsoft SQL Server** source, and incorporates **incremental refresh** for optimal performance with large datasets.

Figure 1: Loan Default Overview & Trends
- Identifies patterns and key drivers of loan defaults.
- Visualizes default rates across dimensions like employment type and loan purpose.
- Tracks trends over time, including Year-over-Year (YoY) changes.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ üë• Applicant Demographics & Financial Profile

Figure 3: Financial Risk Metrics & Advanced Analysis
- Provides key financial indicators for risk assessment.
- Calculates metrics like average and median loan amounts, YoY, and YTD trends.
- Uses advanced DAX logic for segmentation (e.g., by mortgage, dependents, credit score).

## üí° Highlighted DAX Measures & Use Cases

```DAX
-- Default Rate by Employment Type
DefaultRate = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Data), Data[Default] = "Yes"),
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Data))
)

-- YOY Loan Amount Change
YOY Loan Amount = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Data[LoanAmount]),
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Data[Loan Date])
)
